## Assembly
1. Print all 3mf files at 0.2 mm layer height (or finer).
2. Press fit the motors, board, and sensor into the body.
3. Use the tire mold with silicone (1:1 ratio) to create soft rubber tires.
4. Attach the castor ball in the front slot.

For each pair of tires, prepare ~12g of A and ~12g of B.  

### Steps
1. Measure parts ~12g of A and ~12g of B.
